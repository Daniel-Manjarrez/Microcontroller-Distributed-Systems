# Microcontroller Distributed System Spaceteam

# About
Spaceteam is a multiplayer game that uses the ESPNOW protocol where players must cooperate to completing various tasks in order to fix their ship and progress through levels. Players communicate
with one another to convey the different tasks that need to be done, and the person with the task available will press the corresponding button to complete the task. We wanted to build on the Spaceteam implementation found [here](https://github.com/ttseng/COMS3930-Fall2024/blob/main/Module%203/espaceteam.ino)

# Design Goals
- Implement an upgraded timer that causes a game over when expired
- Erase random letters to make the game progressively more difficult
- Added level up and game over screens
- Restarting the game when over

# Installation
To install the game, you need at least 2 ESP32 displays and must be within close range to one another. Simply plug the ESP's into your computers and upload the attached code.
